What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A merge combines the heads of two branches, essentially "merging" the branches such that the new head of both branches is the same
A rebase however combines the branches into one singular branch, so that there is only one branch leading to the head commit
What is a remote repository?
A remote repository is very simply just a copy of a git repository hosted on a machine other than the local repository's machine, such as the github servers, which enables collaboration(pushing pulling from or to a remote) or it allows you to backup your repositories
